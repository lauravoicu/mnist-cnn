# Written Digit Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks on the MNIST Dataset



MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) is a well-known dataset used in Computer Vision that was built by Yann Le Cun et. al. It is composed of images that are handwritten digits (0-9), split into a training set of 50,000 images and a test set of 10,000 where each image is of 28 x 28 pixels in width and height.

This dataset is often used for practicing any algorithm made for image classification as the dataset is fairly easy to conquer. In this project I built a convolutional neural network using Keras which achieves 99.8% accuracy on the dataset and used streamlit and heroku to deploy the model.
